## Configuration

react-native
keep on complainly JAVA_HOME has wrong path
export JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\OpenJDK\openjdk-8u312-b07

cannot beleive the environment variable are different between bash and cmd
and JAVA_HOME should be the main installed directory rather than the bin folder of the JAVA.exe
